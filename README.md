# E-Commerce-Chatbot
ChatBot is a conversational agent developed using Python and Keras, designed to interact with users, answer questions, and provide assistance on various topics. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user input and generate appropriate responses.
The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents, which includes various patterns of user queries and their corresponding intents. The dataset is provided in JSON format (intents.json) and can be customized to suit specific use cases.
